/**
 * Simple mock service, leveraging Express to handle POST and GET requests,
 * It has an in-memory "synchronization" mechanism through which it is possible to see if the mock is actually being invoked, including a timeout mechanism.
 * In order to use the mock service, for each end point you need to register a MockURL (e.g. a PostMock or a GetMock). This Mock must also be used for the synchronization.
 * Note that the same mock can be used for multiple calls to the end point, and it keeps track of the number of calls, including the number of waits for a call.
 * Also currently it allows to start/stop the Express service, but there is no state cleanup for it (and no testcase using it either).
